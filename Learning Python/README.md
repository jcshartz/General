Learning Python README
===============

**Welcome!**

I intend this readme to be a repository of useful links to knowledge of the Python programming language. In addition, this folder contains notes and programs designed to help facilitate learning the Python programming language. As I continue to learn I will post my Python experments as well as utilitarian Python programs I hope to use for work.
